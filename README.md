# iota.rs

ðŸš§ This repository now targets Chrysalis part 2! It will have many breaking change along the way. Please use with caution! ðŸš§

This is the **alpha** version of official Rust library, which allows you to do the following:
* Create transactions
* Sign transactions
* Generate addresses
* Interact with an IOTA node

This client library is still in the alpha stage but it should cover most use cases. The main crate is under `iota-core`. The librarnamed `iota` re-exports fundamental crates from `bee` and also provides client features and utilities. API calls like `post_message` and `get_outputs` are supported. There may be some performance and stability issues. Please report any issues in our [issue tracker](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.rs/issues).

## Requirements

To use the library, we recommend you update Rust to latest stable version [`$ rustup update stable`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup.rs#keeping-rust-up-to-date). Nightly should be fine but some changes might not be compatible.

`no_std` is not currently supported, but we are working on it in [bee](https://github.com/iotaledger/bee), and will provide it as feature once new library implementation is ready.

### Dependencies

`cmake` and `openssl` are required to compile the MQTT dependencies.

### Windows

`cmake` can be downloaded on the [official website](https://cmake.org/download/) and `openssl` can be installed with [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) or [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/).

- Installing `openssl` with `vcpkg`:

```
$ ./vcpkg.exe install openssl:x64-windows
$ ./vcpkg.exe integrate install
# you may want to add this to the system environment variables since you'll need it to compile the crate
$ set VCPKGRS_DYNAMIC=1
```

- Installing `openssl` with `chocolatey`:

```
$ choco install openssl
# you may need to set the OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR environment variable
$ set OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR="C:\Program Files\OpenSSL-Win64"
```

### macOS

`cmake` and `openssl` can be installed with `Homebrew`:

```
$ brew install cmake
$ brew install openssl@1.1
# you may want to add this to your .zshrc or .bashrc since you'll need it to compile the crate
$ OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR=$(brew --prefix openssl@1.1)
```

### Linux

Install `cmake` and `openssl` with your distro's package manager or download from their websites.

## Using the library

Using the library is fairly easy, just add it as dependancy in `Cargo.toml`:

```
[dependencies]
iota-core = { git = "https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.rs", branch = "dev" }
```

And then you can use the library in your code with `iota`.

## API reference

You can read the [API reference](https://docs.rs/iota-core) here, or generate the reference yourself.

If you'd like to explore the implementation in more depth, the following command generates docs for the whole crate, including private modules:

```
cargo doc --document-private-items --no-deps --open
```

## Examples

You can see the examples in the [examples](examples/) directory and try them with:

```
cargo run --example balance
```

## Supporting the project
